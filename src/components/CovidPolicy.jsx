                        You can do this via the paper card you carry in your wallet or by showing us your digital “NHS Covid Pass”.
                        To get the NHS Covid Pass you’ll need to register on the NHS App and download it to your phone ahead of time. To register, the process takes around 5-10 mins but it can take up to 24 hours for the NHS to process so please do this ahead of time. You can then save the pass into your digital wallet for easy access.
